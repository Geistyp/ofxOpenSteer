This is a iOS version of ofxOpenSteer, use openFrameWorks 0.8.0. 

Change a lot from origin code.

WIP:
Add more performance to iOS ( Fraps is low in this version )

# ofxOpenSteer #
Openframeworks lightweight wrapper for the opensource steering behaviors library [OpenSteer](http://opensteer.sourceforge.net/).

This addon was started by Philip Whitfield and extended by Paulo Barcelos.
This is just a fork with fixed includes for the library that wouldn't work with removing 'OpenSteer/' string in each one.

The official OpenSteer sources are [here](http://opensteer.sourceforge.net)
